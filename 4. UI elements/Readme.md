# User Interface elements
Because a mobile application can have so many features and actions taken cared of, it is important to be able to add special designed elements for each action to improve user experience: for instance, to navigate to the previous page the user would expect a button on the left side of the application because this is consistent with turning left to go back to one previous place - therefore, it is expected. No user would think a toogle would take him or her back to the previous page, just like no one will think an image will expect an input.

## Buttons
_What does this button do?_

Ever sincer Dexter's sister Dee Dee started pushing buttons in her brother's laboratory, people started to _experience_ pushing buttons, having already in their subconscious that something would (or at least should) happen.

In terms of mobile applications, buttons are used generally to submit or enter data - any user would first complete some text entries and push a button after, expecting for that data to be added.

In the shopping list application, it was previously mentioned that the MainPage consist of two parts, the content and the action part. In the action part, a button is added to allow the user to add a new element to the list - add a suggestive icon to that button and you come up good user experience.
